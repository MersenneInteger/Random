This program accpets and reads two command line arguments (excluding ./exe), 
the first being either "wc" which simulates the wc command in UNIX or "cat" 
which simulates the cat command. The second command line argument accepts a filename
to be used with either of the commands. For the time being only .txt files are compatible.

Ex: 

./exe wc test.txt

 1 11 62 test.txt
 
 ./exe cat test.txt
 
 "displays contents of test.txt"
